<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lignosulfonate-based Concrete Admixtures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Entrained Agent</li><li>Swelling Agent</li><li>Waterproof Agent</li><li>Antifreeze</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Lignosulfonate-based concrete admixtures refer to chemical additives used in concrete production to enhance its properties. The air entrained agent is used to create small air bubbles in concrete, increasing its durability and resistance to freeze-thaw damage. Swelling agents improve the ability of concrete to withstand external pressure and stress. Waterproof agents enhance the impermeability of concrete, preventing water penetration. Antifreeze agents are used in cold weather conditions to lower the freezing point of water in concrete, allowing it to set properly.</p></p>
