<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-performance NdFeB Permanent Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bonded NdFeB Magnets</li><li>Sintered NdFeB Magnets</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The high-performance NdFeB permanent magnets market is divided into two main types: bonded NdFeB magnets and sintered NdFeB magnets. Bonded NdFeB magnets are made by mixing NdFeB powder with a binder material and then pressing the mixture into the desired shape. They have lower magnetic properties but offer better dimensional accuracy. On the other hand, sintered NdFeB magnets are produced by compacting NdFeB powder into a die and then sintering it under high temperature and pressure. These magnets have higher magnetic properties but may have lower dimensional accuracy due to the complex manufacturing process.</p></p>
