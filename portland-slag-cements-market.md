<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portland-Slag Cements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard Consistency</li><li>Extra Thick Consistency</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Portland-slag cements are categorized based on their consistency, specifically the Standard Consistency and Extra Thick Consistency markets. Standard Consistency refers to the state of the cement paste when it has a certain level of plasticity and doesn't flow excessively. This consistency is ideal for general construction purposes. On the other hand, the Extra Thick Consistency market refers to a more viscous or paste-like state of the cement paste, which is suitable for specialized applications that require high resistance to flow or better cohesion.</p></p>
