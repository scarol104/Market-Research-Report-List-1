<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Corrosion Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Corrosion Inhibitor</li><li>Inorganic Corrosion Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Boiler Corrosion Inhibitor market consists of two main types: organic corrosion inhibitors and inorganic corrosion inhibitors. Organic corrosion inhibitors are compounds derived from natural sources or synthesized chemically. They form a protective layer on the metal surfaces within the boiler, preventing corrosion. On the other hand, inorganic corrosion inhibitors are typically metallic compounds or salts that react with the metal surfaces, forming a protective layer that inhibits corrosion. Both types of corrosion inhibitors play a crucial role in protecting boilers from the damaging effects of corrosion.</p></p>
