<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hurricane Resistant Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Insulated Laminated Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hurricane resistant glass is designed to withstand the high winds and impact of hurricanes. Laminated glass is made by sandwiching a layer of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) between two layers of glass, creating a strong and durable barrier. This type of glass is commonly used in windows, doors, and skylights. Insulated laminated glass is a variation that incorporates a low-E coating and an air gap between the glass layers, providing not only hurricane resistance but also energy efficiency and sound insulation properties. Both types of glass are essential for protecting buildings during severe weather events.</p></p>
