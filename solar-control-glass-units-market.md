<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Control Glass Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbing Solar Control Glass</li><li>Reflective Solar Control Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar control glass units are a type of glass used in buildings to control the amount of solar radiation that enters the interior. Absorbing solar control glass is designed to absorb and dissipate solar energy, preventing it from passing through the glass. This type of glass is usually tinted and reduces glare and solar heat gain. Reflective solar control glass, on the other hand, reflects a significant portion of solar energy, reducing heat and glare. It is coated with a thin metallic layer that gives it a reflective appearance.</p></p>
