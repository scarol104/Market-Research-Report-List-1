<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-wear Cast Iron Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>White Cast Iron</li><li>Chilled Cast Iron</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-wear cast iron market encompasses two main types: white cast iron and chilled cast iron. White cast iron is a hard and brittle material commonly used in applications requiring high wear resistance, such as engine cylinders or rolls in mills. This type of cast iron contains cementite, making it highly resistant to wear but also more susceptible to cracking. On the other hand, chilled cast iron has a hardened surface due to rapid cooling during production, providing excellent resistance to wear and deformation. This type is often used in applications where toughness is also needed.</p></p>
