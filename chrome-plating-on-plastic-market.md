<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chrome Plating On Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plating</li><li>Electroless Plating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chrome plating on plastic is a process where a thin layer of chromium is electroplated onto plastic surfaces to enhance their appearance and durability. There are two main market types in this industry: plating and electroless plating. Plating involves a traditional electroplating process, where a conductive layer is applied to the plastic surface before chrome plating. On the other hand, electroless plating uses a chemical reaction to deposit the chrome layer directly onto the plastic without the need for a conductive layer, making it a more cost-effective and versatile option.</p></p>
