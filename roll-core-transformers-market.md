<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roll-core Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Type</li><li>Oil-immersed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Roll-core transformers are classified into two market types: dry type and oil-immersed type. Dry type transformers do not require any liquid for cooling and insulation, instead, they use air and solid insulating materials such as epoxy resin or cast resin. These transformers are suitable for indoor installations and are environmentally friendly due to the absence of oil. On the other hand, oil-immersed transformers use mineral oil for both cooling and insulation purposes. They are widely used in outdoor installations and have better heat dissipation capabilities.</p></p>
