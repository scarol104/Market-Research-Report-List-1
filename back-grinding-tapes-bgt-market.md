<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Back Grinding Tapes (BGT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV Type</li><li>Non-UV Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Back Grinding Tapes (BGT) are used in the semiconductor industry for thinning and grinding processes. UV Type BGT is a type of BGT that uses ultraviolet (UV) light to cure the adhesive, providing better adhesion strength and heat resistance. Non-UV Type BGT, on the other hand, does not require UV light for curing and has good adhesion properties even at room temperature. Both types have their own market, with UV Type being preferred for high-performance applications and Non-UV Type being more cost-effective for general-purpose thinning processes.</p></p>
