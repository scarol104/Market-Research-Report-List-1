<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CAD Simulation Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud-Based CAD Simulation Software</li><li>On-Premised CAD Simulation Software</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cloud-based CAD simulation software refers to software solutions that are hosted and accessed via the internet, allowing users to run simulations remotely without the need for installing software on local systems. On the other hand, on-premised CAD simulation software is installed and run locally on individual computers or servers within an organization's infrastructure. Both types of software provide 3D modeling and simulation capabilities, but differ in terms of accessibility, maintenance, and scalability. Cloud-based software offers greater flexibility, scalability, and accessibility, while on-premised software provides more control and security.</p></p>
