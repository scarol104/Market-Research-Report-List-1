<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scratch Proof Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemically-strengthened Glass</li><li>Sapphire Glass</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Scratch-proof glass refers to a type of glass that is highly resistant to scratches, maintaining its clarity and durability. Chemically-strengthened glass is a common type of scratch-proof glass, made by immersing the glass in a chemical bath to exchange the sodium ions on its surface with larger potassium ions, creating compression stress that strengthens the glass. Sapphire glass, on the other hand, is a scratch-proof glass made from synthetic sapphire, a material second only to diamond in hardness. It is mainly used in high-end devices like smartphones to prevent scratches and damage to the screen.</p></p>
