<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Masterbatches Anti-Static Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Migratory Antistats</li><li>Non-Migratory Antistats</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Masterbatches anti-statics are additives used in the plastics industry to prevent the build-up of static electricity. There are two main types of masterbatches anti-statics: migratory antistats and non-migratory antistats. Migratory antistats are compounds that can migrate to the surface of the plastic and create a thin layer that dissipates static charges. Non-migratory antistats, on the other hand, remain within the plastic and provide longer-term static protection. Both types are important in different applications, depending on the desired level of anti-static properties and their longevity.</p></p>
