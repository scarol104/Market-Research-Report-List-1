<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Airlaid Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Bonding</li><li>Thermal Bonding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electronic airlaid paper market consists of two main types: chemical bonding and thermal bonding. Chemical bonding involves the use of adhesives or chemicals to bond the fibers together, resulting in a strong and durable paper. Thermal bonding, on the other hand, utilizes heat to melt the fibers and create a bond. This method is often quicker and more cost-effective but may result in a slightly weaker paper. Both types of bonding have their applications, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the end-use product.</p></p>
