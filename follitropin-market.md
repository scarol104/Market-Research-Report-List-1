<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Follitropin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Urine-Derived Follicle Stimulating Hormone</li><li>Follitropin-α</li><li>Follitropin-β</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Follitropin is a type of hormone used in fertility treatments. Urine-derived follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is obtained from the urine of postmenopausal women. Follitropin-α and Follitropin-β are both recombinant forms of FSH, produced by genetic engineering techniques. Follitropin-α is used in controlled ovarian stimulation to induce multiple egg production. Follitropin-β is used for treatment of male and female infertility, as well as in assisted reproductive technology procedures. All three types of follitropin play a crucial role in stimulating the development and maturation of ovarian follicles in women.</p></p>
