<p><strong>The Tyre Cord Fabrics Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire (semi-steel)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The tyre cord fabrics market finds its primary applications in the production of two major types of tires: bias tires and radial tires (semi-steel). Bias tires are constructed by overlapping several layers of fabric at specific angles, providing high load-bearing capacity and durability. On the other hand, radial tires (semi-steel) have fabric cords that run radially from the tire's center, imparting enhanced stability, grip, and fuel efficiency. These tire cord fabrics play a crucial role in reinforcing the structural integrity of both bias and radial tires, ultimately ensuring their optimal performance and safety on the road.</p></p>
