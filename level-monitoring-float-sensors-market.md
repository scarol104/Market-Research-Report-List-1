<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Level Monitoring Float Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Top-mounted Type</li><li>Side-Mounted Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Level monitoring float sensors are devices used to measure the levels of liquids in tanks or containers. The top-mounted type is installed on the top of a tank and is used when the liquid rises or falls to a certain level. It is commonly used in applications such as wastewater treatment and industrial tanks. On the other hand, side-mounted type is installed on the side of a tank and detects the liquid level by floating on the surface. This type is suitable for smaller tanks and is often utilized in industries like food and beverage.</p></p>
