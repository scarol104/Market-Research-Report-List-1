<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Sorting Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tilt-tray</li><li>Cross-belt</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automatic Sorting Systems are industrial solutions designed to efficiently sort items based on specific criteria. Two common types of such systems are Tilt-tray and Cross-belt markets. Tilt-tray sorting systems use trays that tilt to unload items onto chutes, ensuring precise sorting. They are ideal for fragile or high-value items. On the other hand, Cross-belt sorting systems employ belts that run perpendicular to the sorting direction, allowing items to be individually diverted into different chutes. This type excels at high-speed sorting and can handle a wide range of item sizes and weights.</p></p>
