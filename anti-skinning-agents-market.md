<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-skinning Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxime</li><li>Phenols</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Anti-skinning agents are used in paints, coatings, and printing inks to prevent the formation of skins on their surfaces during storage. There are two main types: oxime and phenols. Oxime-based anti-skinning agents function by inhibiting the polymerization process, preventing the formation of a skin layer. Phenol-based anti-skinning agents, on the other hand, act as radical scavengers, effectively terminating the polymerization process. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and usability of paints, coatings, and inks by preventing the formation of unwanted skins.</p></p>
