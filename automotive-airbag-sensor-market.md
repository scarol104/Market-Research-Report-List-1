<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airbag Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sensor</li><li>Passive Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Airbag Sensor Market consists of two types of sensors: active sensor and passive sensor. Active sensors are designed to actively measure and detect changes in the vehicle's surroundings, such as speed or impact. They provide real-time information to the airbag system, allowing for a more accurate and timely deployment of airbags in the event of a collision. On the other hand, passive sensors are typically placed within the airbag system and passively monitor various parameters, such as occupant weight or seatbelt usage, to optimize the deployment of airbags and improve passenger safety.</p></p>
