<p><strong>The Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PWR</li><li>BWR</li><li>PHWR</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) refers to the components and systems of a nuclear power plant that produce and supply steam to generate electricity. There are three main types of nuclear reactors in the market: Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), Boiling Water Reactor (BWR), and Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR). PWRs use water under high pressure to keep it in a liquid state and transfer heat to the steam generator. BWRs use boiling water to directly produce steam for the turbine. PHWRs use heavy water as a coolant and moderator to transfer heat to the steam generator.</p></p>
