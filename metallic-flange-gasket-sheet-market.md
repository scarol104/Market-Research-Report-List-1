<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Flange Gasket Sheet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat Flange</li><li>Non-planar Flange</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The metallic flange gasket sheet market includes two types: flat flange and non-planar flange. In the flat flange market, gasket sheets are designed to fit between two flat surfaces, providing a seal against leakage. Non-planar flange gasket sheets, on the other hand, are used when the flange surfaces are not perfectly flat, such as in raised face or ring-type joint flanges. These gaskets compensate for irregularities in the flange surface, ensuring a tight and secure seal.</p></p>
