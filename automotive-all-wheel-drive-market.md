<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive All Wheel Drive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic AWD Systems</li><li>Manual AWD Systemss</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive all-wheel drive (AWD) market comprises two types: automatic AWD systems and manual AWD systems. Automatic AWD systems are designed to activate and distribute power to all four wheels automatically, without any input from the driver, when traction is lost. On the other hand, manual AWD systems require driver intervention to engage or disengage the AWD mode. Both systems aim to provide improved stability, traction, and handling on various road conditions to enhance overall driving performance.</p></p>
